I am a Technical writer with a background in Web development.

I am familiar with technical concepts and enjoy writing non-technical and developer documentation to improve user experience with technical products.

I have three years experience writing Product documentation, Marketing copy, technical blog posts, User guides, and API documentation to ease the adoption and use of software technologies.

I also help projects analyze their website Information Architecture and design websites. I enjoy learning new technologies and seeking opportunities to grow as a technical writer.

On the side, I run my own SaaS projects.
