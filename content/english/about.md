I am a Technical writer with a background in Web development.

I understand technical concepts and procedures and enjoy writing user-facing documentation that improves user experience with technical products.

I write product documentation, Marketing copy, technical blog posts, User guides, and API documentation to ease the adoption and use of software technologies.

I also analyze and design documentation for software companies and websites. I enjoy learning new technologies and seeking opportunities to grow as a technical writer.
