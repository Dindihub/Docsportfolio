It's great that content writers are turning to AI to speed up their work. But without a human touch AI content is cliche, repetitive, and monotonous, and can damage your brand in the long run. Readers are smart, and they can spot inauthentic content a mile away. If your website or marketing materials are filled with robotic-sounding text, you risk alienating your audience and losing their trust. 

Think about it: would you rather do business with a company that feels genuine, and relatable, or one that sounds like it's being run by a machine? Your guess is as good as mine. 

As a writer and co-founder who often uses an AI content-generating tool Copyfast.ai, I find myself having to impose some humanity into my articles. In this article, I compiled a few tips and tricks on how I humanize my AI-generated content. 

 ## 1. Mastering Tone; Speaking your audience language  your Articles
Your tone is the attitude you convey, whether it's professional, conversational, humorous, or serious. And, personality is the overall impression you leave on the reader â€“ are you friendly, authoritative, quirky, or something else entirely? These elements are what make your content relatable and engaging.

Connect with your readers authentically by adopting a tone that's familiar to them. Your readers will connect with authentic content because it feels real. If you're writing for a professional audience, you'll want to use a more formal tone. If you're writing for a younger audience, you can be more casual and conversational.

[CopyFast.ai](https://www.copyfast.ai/) helps you find your perfect tone by providing suggestions for improving your writing. The smart editor can identify areas where the tone is inconsistent or inappropriate and offer alternative word choices and sentence structures.

And guess what? Google loves authentic content too! The search engine's algorithms are getting smarter every day at identifying and rewarding websites that provide genuine value to users. By humanizing your AI text, you're not just making it more appealing to readers and boosting your SEO. This blend of human insight and AI power is the future of content.

## 2. Turn AI Giberrish into Gold: Remove AI-generated Words and Phrases
It's easy to recognize AI-generated content because of common texts and phrases. Words popularly used by writers to convey formality and professionalism now seem cliche due to overuse by AI. To sound more genuine you have to replace words like "Unlocking ...", "harnessing", and  "enhance", from your writing. Here's a list of what to look out for.

To avoid repetition, use synonyms, rephrase sentences, and add your unique voice and perspective to the text. Also, use short sentences that are easier to read and understand. Make it a habit to voice your content with a text reader or read it loud yourself. This way you will notice if a sentence is too long. This is where your creativity and expertise come into play.

## 3. Introduce Storytelling (Even in "Technical" Content)
Facts and figures are important, but they're not always the most engaging way to communicate information. Stories, on the other hand, have the power to capture attention, build trust, and make your content more memorable. Even in technical content, you can find ways to add storytelling elements that relate to your audience.

One simple way to include storytelling is to use anecdotes or real-life examples to illustrate your points. Instead of just stating a fact, tell a story about how that fact applies in the real world. Creating personas in your content makes your content more relatable and easier to understand. 

Another way to use storytelling is to create a narrative around your content. Think of your content as a journey that you're taking your readers on. Start with a problem, introduce a solution, and then show how that solution can help your readers achieve their goals.

## 4.  Measuring Success: Tracking the Impact of Humanized AI
Once you've started humanizing your AI content, track your results to see if your efforts are paying off. The key metrics to watch include engagement (e.g., page views, time on site, social shares), conversions (e.g., leads, sales), and brand perception (e.g., customer satisfaction, brand loyalty).

Use analytics tools like Google Analytics to track your website traffic and engagement metrics. Monitor all social media channels to see how your content is being shared and discussed. And conduct customer surveys to gauge their satisfaction with your brand. 

Use the data you collect to tailor your content strategy. Identify what's working and what's not, and make adjustments accordingly. Experiment with different tones, styles, and formats to see what resonates best with your audience. And don't be afraid to celebrate your wins! Recognizing the value of humanized AI content will motivate your team to continue creating high-quality, engaging content that drives results.
